## Project Setup

To setup this project on your local machine, you must have maven installed (instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://howtodoinjava.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-on-windows/))

After cloning the project, navigate to the main project folder (contains src folder) and run the command "mvn clean install -U". For development, your IDE may need additional configuration. For example, on IntelliJ you may need to right-click the pom.xml file or the project folder and click Maven -> Reimport.
